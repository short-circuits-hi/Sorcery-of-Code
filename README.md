## About This Project

This project helps you learn to code through challenges that get harder as you progress!

Complete each task to unlock new lessons. Track your progress with badges and leaderboards.

## My Inspiration

I created this project because I wanted:
- A fun, game-based way to learn coding
- A clear path from Python basics to advanced AI
- To document my learning journey
- To be more active on GitHub

## What You'll Learn

- **Module 0:** Python basics
- **Module 1:** Better Python skills and best practices
- **Module 2:** Machine learning fundamentals
- **Module 3:** Building AI applications
- **Module 4:** Final project to show what you've learned

### Branch Structure

This repository uses a multi-branch strategy:

- **`main`**: Stable, production-ready content
- **`develop`**: Latest approved content before merging to main
- **`module/X`**: Development branches for each module (X = module number)
- **`fix/description`**: Branches for bug fixes and improvements

**For Students:**
- Fork the repository
- Create your solution branch: `username/module-0/lesson-1`
