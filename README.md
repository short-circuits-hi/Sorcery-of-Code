## About This Project

This project helps you learn to code through challenges that get harder as you progress!

Complete each task to unlock new lessons. Track your progress with badges and leaderboards.

## My Inspiration

I created this project because I wanted:
- A fun, game-based way to learn coding
- A clear path from Python basics to advanced AI
- To document my learning journey
- To be more active on GitHub

## What You'll Learn

- **Module 0:** Python basics
- **Module 1:** Better Python skills and best practices
- **Module 2:** Machine learning fundamentals
- **Module 3:** Building AI applications
- **Module 4:** Final project to show what you've learned

## How to Start

1. Fork or clone this repository
2. Start with Module 0
3. Complete the challenges
4. Submit your solutions as pull requests

### How Solutions Are Approved

When you submit a pull request with your solution:
- Automated tests run through GitHub Actions
- The system checks if your code passes all test cases
- No human review needed – it's all automated!
- If tests pass, you automatically receive a key to unlock the next lesson
- The leaderboard updates with your progress

### Branch Structure

This repository uses a multi-branch strategy:

- **`main`**: Stable, production-ready content
- **`develop`**: Latest approved content before merging to main
- **`module/X`**: Development branches for each module (X = module number)
- **`fix/description`**: Branches for bug fixes and improvements

**For Students:**
- Fork the repository
- Create your solution branch: `username/module-0/lesson-1`
- Submit PRs to the `main` branch

This structure teaches Git best practices while keeping content organized.
