# Sorcery of Code - Complete Learning Path

Welcome to your magical coding journey! This document outlines the complete path from Python basics to advanced AI development.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Learning Journey Overview

The Sorcery of Code learning path is designed to progressively build your skills from Python fundamentals to advanced AI and machine learning. Each module contains multiple lessons, each with instructional content and hands-on challenges.

## Module Structure

Each module follows a consistent structure:

1. Lessons (`.md` files) containing instructional content
2. Challenges (`.py` files) with coding exercises to test your knowledge
3. Automated validation to check your solutions
4. Keys that unlock subsequent content when you complete challenges
